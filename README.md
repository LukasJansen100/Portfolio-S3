## Intro
Welcome to my portfolio of Semester 3 on Fontys HBO ICT. 
This portfolio is a collection of all my work during this Semester.
It will include the projects, code and documentation from both my Individual Project and the Group Project.

The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate my personal achievements of this semester, which are necessary to fulfill the learning outcomes.

During this semester I work together with [Teun](https://github.com/TeunMos) on the Individual Project.
