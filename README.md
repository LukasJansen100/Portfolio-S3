## Intro
Welcome to my portfolio of Semester 3 on Fontys HBO ICT. 
This portfolio is a collection of all my work during this Semester.
It will include the projects, code and documentation from both my Individual Project and the Group Project.

The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate my personal achievements of this semester, which are necessary to fulfill the learning outcomes.

During this semester I work together with [Teun](https://github.com/TeunMos) on the Individual Project.

## Personal Learning Outcome Rating
This is a personal  reflection on the learning outcomes for this semester.
Under here is a table where I give myself a rating on each of the learning outcomes and a clarification.

|Learning Outcome|Rating|Clarification|
|:---------------|:-----|:--------|
|Web Application|Advanced|**Userfriendly**: <br/>To make our application as userfriendly as possible we've looked at a lot of other applications to see how they manage their UX. Another thing we did to improve user friendliness was getting feedback from other people. <br/> <br/> **Fullstack**:<br/> We've designed and built our application with a React front-end, and 2 back-end services (Userpreferences-API and Integrations-API), our project uses external api's and services from google for authentication, and open weather map and bron fontys for external data|
|Software Quality|Proficient|**Tooling and Methodology**:<br/> In the individual project we've made Unit tests and Integration tests, to test new features from the userstories. <br/> To apply static code analysis we use SonarCloud, which can detect bugs, code smells and more.<br/> We apply code reviews which are required before branches can be merged into main. 
|Agile Method|Proficient|In the proftaak we use Scrum to work together as a team on our project. Over this semester we've applied things like, sprints, sprint reviews, daily standups, retrospectives, backlogs, and Jira as our scrum tooling. <br/> As a team we've worked together on creating userstories, and refining them so we can balance our workload in a sprint as best as possible.|
