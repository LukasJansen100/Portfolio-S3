## Intro
Welcome to my portfolio of Semester 3 on Fontys HBO ICT. 
This portfolio is a collection of all my work during this Semester.
It will include the projects, code and documentation from both my Individual Project and the Group Project.

The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate my personal achievements of this semester, which are necessary to fulfill the learning outcomes.

During this semester I work together with [Teun](https://github.com/TeunMos) on the Individual Project.

## Project Organizations

## Personal Learning Outcome Rating
This is a personal  reflection on the learning outcomes for this semester.
Under here is a table where I give myself a rating on each of the learning outcomes and a clarification.

|Learning Outcome|Rating|Clarification|
|:---------------|:-----|:--------|
|Web Application|Advanced|**Userfriendly**: To make our application as userfriendly as possible we've looked at a lot of other applications to see how they manage their UX. Another thing we did to improve user friendliness was getting feedback from other people. <br/> <br/> **Fullstack**: We've designed and built our application with a React front-end, and 2 back-end services (Userpreferences-API and Integrations-API), our project uses external api's and services from google for authentication, and open weather map and bron fontys for external data|
|Software Quality|Proficient|**Tooling and Methodology**: In the individual project we've made Unit tests and Integration tests, to test new features from the userstories. <br/> We've build a CI/CD, which automatically builds and tests when new things are pushed to a branch on our repository. When features are merged with the main branch, a docker image is pushed to Dockerhub. <br/> To apply static code analysis we use SonarCloud. We apply (required) code reviews before branches can be merged to main.
