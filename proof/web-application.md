# Web application
*You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.*

## User Friendly
Something that is user friendly can be described as easy to use, learn and understand.
For most (web)applications this is a very important aspect to the user experience (UX), as you generally want your users to have an easy time while using your product.

To ensure the user friendliness in my projects, I have used the following techniques:
- Peer feedback
- Taking inspiration and ideas from other applications

Peer feedback is great because other students usually see things that you didn't see yourself. Since I am working together in both the Individual and Group Projects peer feedback is happening all the time.

Other techniques that I'm planning to use in the future of my projects are:
- Moderated User Testing
- Unmoderated User Testing

You can find more information about the front-end design [here](https://github.com/IPS3-DB04-Teun-Mos-Lukas-Jansen/Documentation/wiki/Documentation-Front-End#designs)

## Full-stack
### What is full-stack developement?
[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack.asp) has the following description of a full stack developer:
>A full stack web developer is a person who can develop both client and server software.
>In addition to mastering HTML and CSS, he/she also knows how to:
>- Program a browser (like using JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, or Vue)
>- Program a server (like using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node)
>- Program a database (like using SQL, SQLite, or MongoDB)

Both the individual and group project are fullstack because we are building the front-end software, as well as the back-ends that communicates with databases or other services.

### Fullstack projects
Under here you can find all the repositories for both the individual and group project.
These include Frontend and Backend projects.
