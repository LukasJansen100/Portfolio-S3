# You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.

## User Friendly
(work in progress)

## Full-stack
[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack.asp) has the following description of a full stack developer:
>A full stack web developer is a person who can develop both client and server software.
>In addition to mastering HTML and CSS, he/she also knows how to:
>- Program a browser (like using JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, or Vue)
>- Program a server (like using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node)
>- Program a database (like using SQL, SQLite, or MongoDB)

Both the individual and group project are fullstack because we are building the front-end software, as well as the back-ends that communicates with databases or other services.

Under here you can find all the repositories for both the individual and group project.
