*You recognize and take into account cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects in software development.*

## Recognition and taking into account of cultural differences and ethical aspects
Recognition and awareness of cultural aspects can be a great help in the Software Engineering business. 
In order to create a product that satisfies the stakeholders, you need to be aware of the cultural expectations they might have.

### Cultural expectations Product Owner
Over the past weeks of this semester I have noticed several cultural expectations our Product Owners have.
They put a lot of value on good communication, this is important for them because in the real world having good communication will save the product owners a lot of time/money. 
This is why we put a lot of effort in our Group Project on communicating with the product owners. 
We know our product owners like to be kept informed about the status of our project, and they don't like suprises during the Sprint-Reviews.
In order to keep them informed we always send them an email before upcoming Sprint-Reviews about the progress we've made, and what they can expect.

The Product Owners have also told us they value honesty, because they know that sometimes you can get stuck with a problem, and it's best to be open about it, so the product owners can help find a solution. This makes sense, because if you keep a lot of things from the product owners, they will find out some day, and not be happy about it.
That's why during the Sprint Reviews we are honest/clear about the progress we've made, even if we made less progress than we were supposed to make.

## Ethical Programming Guidelines
### What are ethics?
> moral principles that govern a person's behaviour or the conducting of an activity.

### Why are ethics in software engineering important?
Ethics in software engineering are important, because the products we build are used world-wide by billions of people.

### The ACM Guidelines
> The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is the world's largest educational and scientific computing society. It has its own Code of Ethics and another set of ethical principles that were also approved by the IEEE as the standard for teaching and practicing software engineering.
