# Cultural differences and ethical aspects
*You recognize and take into account cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects in software development.*

## Recognition and taking into account of cultural differences and ethical aspects
Recognition and awareness of cultural aspects can be a great help in the Software Engineering business. 
In order to create a product that satisfies the stakeholders, you need to be aware of the cultural expectations they might have.

This is why we put a lot of effort in our Group Project on communicating with the product owners. 
We know our product owners like to be kept informed about the status of our project, and they don't like suprises during the Sprint-Reviews.
In order to keep them informed we always send them an email before upcoming Sprint-Reviews about the progress we've made, and what they can expect.



## Ethical Programming Guidelines
### What are ethics?
> moral principles that govern a person's behaviour or the conducting of an activity.

### Why are ethics in software engineering important?
Ethics in software engineering are important, because the products we build are used world-wide by billions of people.

### The ACM Guidelines
> The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is the world's largest educational and scientific computing society. It has its own Code of Ethics and another set of ethical principles that were also approved by the IEEE as the standard for teaching and practicing software engineering.
