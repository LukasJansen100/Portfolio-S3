## What is Agile?
> In software development, agile (sometimes written Agile)[1] practices include requirements discovery and solutions improvement through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams with their customer(s)/end user(s),[2] adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continual improvement, and flexible responses to changes in requirements, capacity, and understanding of the problems to be solved. [Wikipedia Agile software developement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

Agile was popularized in 2001, with the [Manifesto for Agile Software Developement](https://agilemanifesto.org/), in which they wrote [twelve principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) of Agile Software, all deriving from these values:
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan
