# Requirements and design
*You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using multiple types of test techniques*

## Analyzing Requirements
In our group project we have received a paper from our product owners explaining the project, and what they expect us to make.
Together with the group we have analysed the requirements of the project and reconstructed them into user stories. These user stories, can then be put into our sprints and can be implemented into our project.
Userstories and sprints are a part of our [Agile methology](https://github.com/LukasJansen100/Portfolio-S3/blob/main/proof/agile-method.md)

## Eleborate designs

## Test Techniques
> You apply user acceptance testing and stakeholder feedback to validate the quality of the requirements. You evaluate the quality of the design (e.g., by testing or prototyping) taking into account the formulated quality properties like security and performance.
